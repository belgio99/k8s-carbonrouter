## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.

**Contact:** Open a private security advisory on GitHub or reach out via the repository's contact information.

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

As this is a thesis project maintained by a single author, response times may vary. I will do my best to acknowledge reports within a reasonable timeframe and provide updates on the remediation process.

## Security Considerations

This project is intended as a reference implementation for research purposes. Before deploying in production environments:

- Review all configurations and credentials
- Ensure proper RBAC policies are in place
- Use network policies to restrict traffic
- Keep all dependencies up to date
